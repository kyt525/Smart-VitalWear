Problem 5:
I wonder if we can create sensors on every bed sheet that perform a wide variety of monitoring that is now done manually. Examples could be temperature, weight, respiratory weight, variability of motion, detection of seizures, body impedance as a measure of fluid retention and so forth.

Variables to measure and the current solutions:
Temperature: oral and IR
Weight: BMI and scale
Respiratory rate: count
Variability of motion: sight
Detection of seizures: sight
Body impedance as a measure of fluid retention: scale
Oxygen: IR
Heart rate: IR
Blood pressure: air pump and cuff

Potential costs:
software and hardware
sensors
fabric
monitor
