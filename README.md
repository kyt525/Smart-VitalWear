Team 3: Smart VitalWear

Sponsor: David Chan, Carle Hospital

Health Make-a-Thon Dec. 3, 2022 at MSB

Teammates: Jose Beltran (CIMED), Paola R. Castillo Rosario (Community Member), Bhargav Chandaka (CS), Alexander Chang (Engineering), Frank Lu (Engineering), Jainil Maheshwari (Resident), Kathryn Thompson (Engineering)  


Problem Statement:
Monitoring vital health metrics is difficult. There is a lack of integration and consolidation among devices for monitoring vitals. Additionally, the manual vital monitoring/interventions required by nurses can cause alert fatigue and extra workload.
