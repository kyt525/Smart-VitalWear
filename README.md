Health Make-a-Thon Dec. 3, 2022 at MSB

We competed in the UIUC Carle Health Make-a-thon to solve a question posed by our healthcare community for us to solve.

Problem Statement:
Monitoring vital health metrics is difficult. There is a lack of integration and consolidation among devices for monitoring vitals. Additionally, the manual vital monitoring/interventions required by nurses can cause alert fatigue and extra workload.
